For this project I created a text based blackjack game from scratch in java complete with doubling down, splitting and all typical blackjack features.  Built a Deck class of Card objects which creates a fully working and shuffling deck of 52 Card objects.  Simulates a casino, the player enters with $100 and can play until they run out.
